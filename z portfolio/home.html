            <p>Hello! I'm Krishna Sree, a student at SR University, majoring in 
                Computer Science. I'm currently in my second year of studies.<br><br>
                My journey into the realm of computer science began during my school days
                when I was introduced to a wide range of programming languages and tools, 
                such as Small Basic, Visual Basic, HTML, CSS, Scratch, as well as 
                software like Photoshop, Audacity, and Lightworks. It was during this 
                time that my fascination with the world of computers began.<br><br>
                Here's a summary of my skills and interests:<br>
                Programming Languages: Proficient in Python and C.<br>
                Web Development: Skilled in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.<br>
                Currently Expanding Knowledge in Backend Web Development with React, Node.js, and Express.js.<br>
                Interests: Passionate about Web3 technology, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and IoT.<br><br>
